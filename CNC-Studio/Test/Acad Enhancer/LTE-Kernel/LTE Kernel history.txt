******* LTE 2000 Kernel version v.1.7.0.0 *******

Fixed :
=======
- several minor issues with files patching are fixed


Improved :
==========
- LTE now only applies those in-memory modifications to LT, which are absolutely nessecary,
  thus improving stability (previous kernel build sometimes caused trouble)

- LTE now includes internal version management :
  if several LTE based applications are installed using different LTE kernel versions,
  this version management always ensures that the latest kernel build is loaded
  => this prevents serious problems under such situations

- because of optimized LTE kernel technology, unloading arx files works fine like in AutoCAD

- performance and algorithm for file patching is improved

- several workarounds for invalid DLL handling by Windows are implemented
  (Windows sometimes loads the identical DLL file from short-named path and long-named 
   path twice !! - LTE kernel will check this situatuon)

- LTE kernel is now compatible with LTX kernel and LTX based applications :
  if LTX is detected in-memory at LTE startup, LTE kernel will not provide the standard 
  in-memory modifications, because LTX is loaded earlier and will provide these modifications;
  nevetherless, LTE kernel *will* provide those technologies which are not provided by LTX :
  - Lisp (prompt, file, menu)
  - full Acis support
  - LoadLibrary(), LoadLibraryEx() and GetModuleFileHandle() detection

- a message box is displayed if invalid pathnames are defined in "PATH" variable
  => especially WISE installer often places "X:\Pathname" with apostrophes into PATH 
     variable, which is invalid under IWndows and could cause problems finding DLLs

- LTSetup/LTUninst checks for running Aclt.exe to prevent useless registrations


New Features :
==============
- _Union, _Subtract and _Intersect will accept solids now !!!

- AutoLISP is now supported directly at the prompt !!!

- AutoLISP is also supported in Menus now !!! (ConvertMNU.exe is not longer nessecary)

  2 minor limitations with Menu files :

  a) compiled menus (*.mnr/mnc) are always incompatible between AutoCAD & LT
     => therefore, always use a copy of the menu to be used with LT
        (MymMnu.mnu/mns => MyMenu-LT.mnu/mns)

  b) do not use (load lispfile OnError) inside menu
     the "OnError" argument is not supported within menus !
     => therefore, use
        1. (load lispfile) - returns T/NIL
        -or-
        2. (ltload lispfile OnError) - returns T/OnError
     but you can use (load lispfile OnError) in any lisp file without problems


Other news & interesting details :
==================================
During the last time, we have checked some most complex applications with partners & developers :
as a result, we can now definitively state and proof, that LTX kernel can cause serious problems !
Basically the major fault in LTX is related to loading arx files - the technology used by LTX 
will confuse LTs internal arx module management ... this will sometimes cause problem when unloading
modules (arx/dbx/dll) during LT shutdown. Especially applications with multiple & complex 
dependencies between their arx/dbx modules are effected - usually leading into "FATAL ERROR..."
and exception messages.

This was proven with those mentioned applications - after LTE kernel is fully developed now, we 
are proud that LTE kernel will *NOT* confuse LTs internal module management !

Beside this major LTX fault, LTE offers many improvements compared to LTX :

- arx/dbx/dll loading technology is fully compatible with LT !

- all ::LoadModule() and ::LoadModuleEx() calls are monitored to apply file patching to DLL files,
  if nessecary - then, the patched file is loaded; this will reduce the developers' efforts !!
  Important: ::AfxLoadLibrary() calls are *not* monitored !

- all ::GetModuleHandle() calls are monitored, to provide the correct HINSTANCE handle to
  calling applications
  i.e. ::GetModuleHandle("MyApp.arx" will return NULL - this unexpected result usually cause
       problems for the applications ....
       LTE kernel detects these calls and will return the correct HINSTANCE handle, based on
       the file naming convention (*.arx -> *.ltx, *.dll -> *.dlx, *.dbx -> *.dxx, *.abc -> *.ab!)
